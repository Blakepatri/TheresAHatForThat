# CSCI3172 - Web-Centric
Step 1:
To install the application do a git clone from:
https://git.cs.dal.ca/patriquin/csci3172-web-centric.git

Step 2:
Import the database file into MySQL. The file is:
db/TAHFT_DB_Create_FilledTables.sql

This contains some already created accounts. Right now there is only one admin account:
k.pineo@dal.ca
montrealcanadiens

If you wish to change an account to admin simply set the admin field in the Users table to 1.

If for some reason there is a need to change database connection configuration, it is stored in: 
config/database.json 

It looks something like:
{
	"host":"localhost",
	"port":1111,
	"user":"root",
	"password":"MapleLeafsSuck",
	"database":"TAHFT_DB"
}

Step 3:
Install node modules. There is a package.json included with the project. It should be as simple as navigating to the main app directory and doing an npm install.

If that doesnâ€™t work the application only uses three modules not bundled with Node by default:
npm install cookies
npm install formidable
npm install mysql

Step 4:
Configure HTTP server if needed. Mainly the port the server is using. This option is found in AHatForThat.js on line 13:
const serverPort = 80;

Step 5:
Start the server from the directory above the main application directory:
node csci3172-web-centric

or from the main application directory:
node AHatForThat.js

Step 6:
If something breaks on boot please contact Keith: k.pineo@dal.ca
Chances are it is something like a path error or OS specific problem not found during testing. Anything like this should be a one line code fix.
